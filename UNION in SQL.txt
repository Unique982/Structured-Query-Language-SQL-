// UNION 
-> A UNION combines the results of two or more quires into one table.
Rules:
.-> The number of column in each SELECT statement must match.
.-> The data types in the columns should be same.
.-> The columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.
.-> Must have the same expressions and aggreate function in each SELECT statement
.-> The UNION operator selects only distinct value by default and it doesn't select duplicate values.
ex:SELECT name from student UNION SELECT name From employee;

// UNION all
-> UNION ALL returns every match whether it is duplicate or distinct ones.
syntax: SELECT name FROM STUDENT UNION ALL SELECT name FROM empl;
