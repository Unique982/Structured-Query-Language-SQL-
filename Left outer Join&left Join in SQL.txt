//LEFT OUTER JOIN / LEFT JOIN
->The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table, with the matching rows in the 
right table. The result is NULL in the right side when there is no match.
In a LEFT OUTER JOIN the table that comes before the join is the left table,
and the table that comes after join is the right table.

Syntax: SELECT column_name FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON column_name = column_name;
ex: SELECT teacher.t_name,student_reg.address FROM teacher
    -> LEFT JOIN student_reg ON teacher.t_id = student_reg.s_id;
+--------+---------+
| t_name | address |
+--------+---------+
| Raju   | NULL    |
| Gita   | NULL    |
+--------+---------+
(no record address)
